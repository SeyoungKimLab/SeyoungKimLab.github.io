<strong>Research interests: </strong>
My main research interests lie in developing statistical machine learning techniques to address significant methodological problems in computational genomics. Recent advances in genome-wide profiling technology have allowed researchers to probe various aspects of biological systems on a system-wide scale, such as the transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and epigenome. In addition, it is expected that in the future, genome sequencing will become a routine process that can be applied to a large number of individuals. 
Given the high-dimensional nature of genome-scale data in which many entities interact with each other 
in a complex manner, I'm interested in developing statistical machine learning techniques 
for understanding the genetic basis of diseases and disease-related biological processes with the ultimate goal of personalized medicine.

<strong>Bio:</strong>
I received my B.S. in computer engineering from 
Seoul National University, Korea,
and Ph.D. in from the University of California, Irvine.
I was a postdoctoral fellow 
in Machine Learning Department at 
Carnegie Mellon University. 
I was an Assistant and Associate Professor in Computational Biology Department, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University until 2023.
I was on parental leave during 2015 spring and 2016-2018 academic years for my two children.
I received an NSF Career Award and Sloan Research Fellowship.
